This is an analysis of the big 5 leagues, trying to identify the main differences between them, this is my first code and it took quite long since i'm new on this python world, so far it's been really interesting.

Information was taken from Data World URL (https://data.world/dcereijo/player-scores#) this is also available in Kaggle, special thanks to the people that made this information available, it's been really fun to go through the data

I'm a passionate for soccer and I consider among many that Premier-League is the best league there is, hope this is useful and joyful for all of you.
